# Goal / Inspiration
My partner and I set out to create a visual novel in p5.js based off of the four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring). We were heavily inspired by the lofi music we picked for our sketches and the style a lot of lofi music videos have. A lot of lofi music will have animated backgrounds with a little bit of movement included, so that is what we based our sketches around. All of our sketches for each season have movement based off of the music frequencies being played at that moment in time and each of them tells a story of a different season.
