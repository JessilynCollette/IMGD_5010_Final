# Project Overview
Our project is a series of p5.js sketches telling a story for each one of the four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring). The skethes are set to a lofi song that we feel represents the transition to each season very well. Each season has its own unique animations and color palattes that we carefully constructed to invoke the feeling you get when the weather starts to change.


# Goal / Inspiration
We were heavily inspired by the lofi music we picked for our sketches and the style a lot of lofi music videos have. A lot of lofi music will have animated backgrounds with a little bit of movement included, so that is what we based our sketches around. All of our sketches for each season have movement based off of the music frequencies being played at that moment in time and each of them tells a story of a different season.
